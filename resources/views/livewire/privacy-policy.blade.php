                <h3>7.  International transfers</h3>
                <p>
                    The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and the laws of those countries may differ from the laws applicable in your own country. We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of it outside of your jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever we transfer your personal data, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
                </p>
                <h3>8.	Data security</h3>
                <p>
                    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure. We have therefore put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
                </p>
                <h3>9.	Data retention</h3>
                <p>
                    How long will you use my personal data? We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation with respect to our relationship with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some circumstances, we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, wherein we may use this information indefinitely without further notice.
                </p>
                <h3>10.	Your legal rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your data. Please note that you are entitled to these rights as listed below. Scroll to the glossary section below to find out more:

                <p>
                    <p>You have the right to:</p>
                    <p><b>Request access</b> to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
